cabal-plan-bounds: generate cabal bounds from actual build plans
================================================================

TL;DR: Updates the `.cabal` file `build-depends` and `tested-with` based on the
`build.json` of actual build paths. Builds upon [cabal-fmt] to edit the .cabal
file in place
