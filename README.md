cabal-plan-bounds: generate cabal bounds from actual build plans
================================================================

TL;DR: Updates the `.cabal` fileâ€™s `build-depends` and (not yet) `tested-with` based on the
`build.json` of actual build paths.

TODO: Explain the issue and how this looks. Until then,
see https://discourse.haskell.org/t/dependency-version-bounds-are-a-lie/5522/22?u=nomeata
